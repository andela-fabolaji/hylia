However, to make this very effective, please take a sample paper and write these words, keep them in your wallet or bag- somewhere very accessible.

### 1. I AM BEAUTIFULLY MADE; I AM GOD'S IMAGE

[Genesis Chapter 1 verse 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis1:7&version=NLT)

It is of utmost importance to remind ourselves daily that God created us in his own likeness to represent him on earth. Our awareness and understanding of our identity in God is a testament of God’s unending love for us.

### 2. GOD LOVES ME UNCONDITIONALLY

[James 1 : 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James1:17&version=NLT) [Genesis 27 : 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis27:29&version=NLT)

The unconditional love of the father is an assurance of the fulfilment of his promises in our lives. The steadfast love of the lord is renewed every morning. Say this to yourself:

> “God loves me too much to watch me languish in pain and suffering. He will wipe my tears and heal my broken heart.”

### 3. I AM A CHANNEL OF BLESSING TO MY GENERATION

[James 1 : 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James1:17&version=NLT) [Genesis 27 : 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis27:29&version=NLT)

One of our core responsibilities as God’s creation is to be a vessel of blessing to our generation. As the light of God, we are created to radiate his glory amongst our peers. So, anytime you find your self giving up, say this to yourself:

> “God created me for his purpose, and that I will fulfil. I am blessed to bless others. I will radiate his glory and inspire my generation. I am the change.”

### 4. I AM A CHILD OF LIGHT

[John 8 : 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John8:12&version=NLT) [John 9 : 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John9:5&version=NLT)

It is important to become fully aware that there is a difference between light and darkness, and that light illuminates darkness. Now take a look at yourself as that light and say:

*"I am the solution to problems, i am vibrant and important to the world. I am the light of God".*

> John 1:9 (NLT): "The one who is the true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world." 

Importantly, let the Word of Christ as said in  John 1 verses 9 be  made Evident. 

### 5. I HAVE TRUE RICHES IN CHRIST

[](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev3:17&version=NLT) [1 Sam 2 :8 ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+2%3A8&version=KJV)

True riches and power to make wealth comes from God. But, because of the pre-conceived notion some Christians have, they feel comfortable in penury, as the fear of falling into evil has stopped them from attaining greatness, affluence and wealth, See: 

> *1 Timothy 6:10 "For the Love of money is the root of all evil..."* 

Other Christian believe that God's will for some was to be poor. After all, the Bible has said:

> *John 12:8, "you will always have the poor among you..."* 

And so, God can decide to bless some, and decide to make some poor. Well, these assumptions are wrong and are not God's plan for us. Some others are just lazy and not taking the necessary steps to becoming wealthy, because they lack the understanding

This category of Christian, are those who are ignorant of their divine rights in Christ Jesus. The decision to be poor or remain poor is solely depends on the individual, and not God- He wants us to be rich.

>  *3 John 2, I wish above all things, that you prosper and be in good health, even as your soul prosper* 

More so, it is not enough to just depend solely on God to make us rich, we also need to take action. The natural law that work with riches says: 

> "While the earth remains, seed time, harvest time shall not cease". 

And so, we are to bring the fulfillment of God's word in our lives through actions else we will remain void.

 A daily reminder to yourself should be: 

*"I have True riches in Christ Jesus; in Him there is wealth, and riches everlasting"*

 Remember, it is important that we always back up our Faith and Prayers with Smart work and diligence. 

These are few words of assurance and exaltation that should be said every day. You have control over your mind and what you feel now, pay attention to it and feed it with positivity.
