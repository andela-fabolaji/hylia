You have to take charge of your life, You need to make sure every moment count;  even at your most vulnerable point, take charge of how you feel; listen to the moment, pay attention to it, and speak positive words.

In this post, i have listed out five important words to say to yourself everyday to help you stay charged, focused and reminded of the reasons you are here. So hold still and enjoy this moment.

However, to make this very effective, please take a sample paper and write these words, keep them in your wallet or bag- somewhere very accessible.

**1. I AM BEAUTIFULLY MADE IN GODS IMAGE**

   *Genesis chapter 1 verses 7* 

It is best that we always remind ourselves that God has not just created us in some kind of way, but has taken his time to create us in his own image and likeness. he has created us just as he is, and so "i am gods image". i represent god in earth. when we fully become aware of how much we represent god, then it makes us conscious of the fact that we are loved by Him.

 **2. GOD LOVES ME; HE IS NEVER ANNOYED WITH ME**         

*James 1 verses 17; Genesis 27 verses 29.*

 When we are fully aware of the love the Father has towards us, then it makes us assured of His promises for us. say to yourself right now; 

*"God loves me, He can not watch me suffer, He can not watch me go through pains, He can not make me cry, He can not leave me heartbroken".* 

More so, The Bible has enumerated God's promises for us, this is because of the Love He has for us- His children. He loves us, relentlessly.

**3. I AM CREATED TO BE A BLESSING TO MY GENERATION**

 *James 1 verses 17; Genesis 27 verses 29.*

It is important to be aware daily that we- Gods creation are created to be a blessing, and we are created to become an inspiration to others. and so, at that moment you feel like giving up, just remember, and say to yourself *:* 

*"God has me created for a purpose, and i will fulfill that; i am blessed to bless others, i will inspire my generation, i am that change".*
