You have to take charge of your life, You need to make sure that every moment of it count;  even at your most vulnerable point, take charge of how you feel; listen to the mind, pay attention to what it says and speak positive words.

In this post, i have listed out five important words with biblical references to say to yourself everyday to help you stay charged, focused and reminded of the reasons you are here, and so hold still and enjoy this moment.

However, to make this very effective, please take a sample paper and write these words, keep them in your wallet or bag- somewhere very accessible.

**1. I AM BEAUTIFULLY MADE IN GODS IMAGE**

   *Genesis chapter 1 verses 7* 

It is very important that we remind ourselves always that God has not just created us in some kind of way, but has taken time to create us in his own image and likeness. he has created us just as he is, and so -I am God's image. We fully represent Him on earth. The moment we become fully aware of how much we represent God, then it makes us very conscious of the fact that we are Loved by Him.

 **2. GOD LOVES ME; HE IS NEVER ANNOYED WITH ME**         

*James 1 verses 17; Genesis 27 verses 29.*

 When we are fully aware of the love the Father has towards us, then it makes us assured of His promises for us. say to yourself right now; 

*"God loves me, He can not watch me suffer, He can not watch me go through pains, He can not make me cry, He can not leave me heartbroken".* 

More so, The Bible has enumerated God's promises for us, this is because of the Love He has for us- His children. He loves us, relentlessly.

**3. I AM CREATED TO BE A BLESSING TO MY GENERATION**

 *James 1 verses 17; Genesis 27 verses 29.*

It is important to be aware daily that we- Gods creation are created to be a blessing, and we are created to become an inspiration to others. and so, at that moment you feel like giving up, just remember, and say to yourself *:* 

*"God has me created for a purpose, and i will fulfill that; i am blessed to bless others, i will inspire my generation, i am that change".* 

**4. I AM A CHILD OF LIGHT**

*John 8 verses 12; John 9 verses 5*

It is very necessary to become fully aware that there is a difference between light and darkness, and that light illuminate darkness- now take a look at yourself as that light and say; 

*"I am the solution to problems, i am very vibrant and important to the world, God the creator has made me the light".*

Importantly, let the Word of Christ as said in  John 1 verses 9 be  made Evident. 

> "John 1:9 The one who is the true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world". *\[NLT]*

**5. I HAVE TRUE RICHES IN CHRIST** 

 *Revelation 3 verses 17; I Samuel 2 verses 7.*

True riches and power to make wealth comes from God. There is however this wrong preconceived notion that some Christians have - they can be Poor because it is the will of God for them, No! See: 

> " II Cor 8:9  For you know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich".

God's will for us is to be prosperous- as he has set down his own ways for us, and so whenever you feel down financially, say to yourself;

*"I have True riches in Christ Jesus; in Him there is wealth, and riches everlasting"*

It is however very vital to know that saying this should be backed with smart work in diligence. Do not forget, take charge!

These are few words of Assurance and Exaltation that should be said every moment and day. Do not forget, you have control over your mind and what you feel now, pay attention to it and speak positive words, speak it out loud always.
