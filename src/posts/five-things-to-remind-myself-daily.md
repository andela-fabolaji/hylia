You have to take charge of your life, You need to make sure that every moment of it count;  even at your most vulnerable point, take charge of how you feel; listen to your mind, pay attention to what it says and speak positive words.

In this post, i have listed five important words with biblical references to say everyday to help you stay charged, focused and reminded of the reasons you are here, so hold still and enjoy this moment.

*To make this very effective, please take a sample paper and write these words, keep them in your wallet or bag- somewhere very accessible.*

### I AM BEAUTIFULLY MADE; I AM GOD'S IMAGE

[Genesis Chapter 1 verse 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis1:7&version=NLT)

It is of utmost importance to remind ourselves daily that God created us in his own likeness to represent him on earth. Our awareness and understanding of our identity in God is a testament of God’s unending love for us.

### GOD LOVES ME UNCONDITIONALLY

[James 1 : 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James1:17&version=NLT) [Genesis 27 : 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis27:29&version=NLT)

The unconditional love of the father is an assurance of the fulfilment of his promises in our lives. The steadfast love of the lord is renewed every morning. Say this to yourself:

> “God loves me too much to watch me languish in pain and suffering. He will wipe my tears and heal my broken heart.”

### I AM A CHANNEL OF BLESSING TO MY GENERATION

[James 1 : 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James1:17&version=NLT) [Genesis 27 : 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis27:29&version=NLT)

One of our core responsibilities as God’s creation is to be a vessel of blessing to our generation. As the light of God, we are created to radiate his glory amongst our peers. So, anytime you find your self giving up, say this to yourself:

> “God created me for his purpose, and that I will fulfill. I am blessed to bless others. I will radiate his glory and inspire my generation. I am the change.”

### I AM A CHILD OF LIGHT

[John 8 : 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John8:12&version=NLT) [John 9 : 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John9:5&version=NLT)

It is important to become fully aware that there is a difference between light and darkness, and that light illuminates darkness. Now take a look at yourself as that light and say:

*"I am the solution to problems, i am vibrant and important to the world. I am the light of God".*

> John 1:9 (NLT): "The one who is the true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world." 

Importantly, let the Word of Christ as said in  John 1 verses 9 be  made Evident.

### GOD'S GRACE IS EVIDENT IN MY LIFE

[ROM 5:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A20&version=NIV)

Being bounded by grace is made possible through the sacrifice Christ has made on the Cross, and just as he rose up from death, we have risen from the power of sin which comes through the Law, to Grace. Now say to yourself:

*"I am bounded by Grace, therefore i am free"*

This implies that we are now free from the punishment attached to the law- Death. We have life eternal, Amen.

These are few words of exaltation to be said yourself daily. Culture your mind to positivity, because: *For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he, proverbs 23:7 (KJV)*.  You have control over your mind and what you feel now, pay attention to it and nurture it with God's word.

Thank you for reading to the very end, God bless you.
