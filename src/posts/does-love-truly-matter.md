Some days ago, while having a conservation with a very close friends of mine around life, love and people in general.  He (my friend) went on to lament about how a supposed friend of his would not put him up for jobs he had at his disposal, but will always come back to him for his opinion on that particular job he has refused to give out- wanting to gain from his own knowledge. Let's say his friend wants to keep using him to his own advantage, but does not want to give him anything in return, and this aroused that big question in me What do you know about love? How do you define love? how can you love truly and genuinely?  well here goes something on this, stay with me. 

Often times, we get too engulfed with  this word "Love" because it is only very easy to say rather than doing it- the action of the word itself. Our definition of love although differ because of our human mind and its uniqueness in the way it process and react to things, but no definition can beat love as "sacrifice". If truly you love me, how far can you go for me?

A quick question, can you actually love another genuinely without loving yourself? the truth is loving another is very hard, but loving yourself is harder because we are humans and we tend  to react to words said by people which can change the love you have for yourself.  Loving yourself should always be the first step in love process. If you can love yourself genuinely and wholeheartedly, the loving another can never even be challenging because you experience Love. The instruction of loving according to the Bible says "Love your neighbor as yourself" because it is assumed that you must love yourself first. SELF LOVE IS IMPORTANT!

Taking a look at our Heavenly Father who is creator of "Love". He loves us and can not afford to let us perish in our wayward ways, so he sent his only son JESUS to die for us [(John 3:16)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NIV)- This a representation of love as sacrifice, nothing beats that.

How do you love? can you love your friend enough to let them take that scholarship meant for you just because they need it more than you do? Can you let your colleague take that promotion because they fit better in that position more than you will? Well, this is a little hard because we are human and every time, we want our ego to win, we want to be the best even if it cost the fall of someone else. Love happens when we begin to to see life from another person's view and try to examine how our little act can bring so much happiness to that person

Love is watching your friend succeed no matter what it cost you, love is letting a stranger have your lunch even when you are hungry, Love is staying there for somebody because they need you, love is praying for somebody even in their absence, love is having the best interest of somebody at heart even if they have hurt you, love is giving,  Love is SACRIFICE.

Loving does not come with a particular race, religion or ethnicity- love everybody. 

Love according to God's own principles:

* Love your neighbor as yourselves [Matt 22: 39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+22%3A39&version=NIV)
* Love because you know God [1 John 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1john+4%3A8&version=NIV)
* love because it gives no record of wrongs [1 Cor 13:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor+13%3A4-5&version=NIV)
* Love because it covers multitude of sins [1 Peter 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4%3A8&version=NIV)
* Love because it comes from God [1 John 4:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A7&version=NIV)

Over all, Love unconditionally. 

Now, does love truly matter? YES! Everyday, love matters. it plays a crucial role in our relationship with ourselves, our spouse, friends, family, colleague and even strangers. Love does matter.  show somebody love today.
