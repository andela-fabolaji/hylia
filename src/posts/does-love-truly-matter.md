Some days ago, i had a discussion with a very close friends of mine around life, love and people in  general.  He went on to tell me about how his friend would not give him a job but always comes back to ask for his opinion on that particular job, wanting to gain from his own knowledge, let's say his friend wants to keep using him to his own advantage, but do not want to give him anything in return, and this made me worry about what our definition of love truly means, well here goes something stay with me. 

Often times, we get too engulfed with this word "Love" because it is only very easy to say rather than doing it- the action of the word itself. Our definition of love although differ because of our human mind and its uniqueness in the way it process and react to things, but no definition can beat love as "sacrifice". If truly you love me, how far can you go for me?

Taking a look at our Heavenly father who is creator of the word "Love". because He loves us and can not afford to let us perish in our wayward ways, so he sent his only son JESUS to die for us [(John 3:16)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NIV)- This a representation of love as sacrifice, nothing beats this love.

How do you love? Do you love your friend enough to let them take that scholarship meant for you just because they need it more than you do? Can you let your colleague take that promotion because they fit better in that position more than you will? Well, this is a little hard because we are human and every time we want our ego to win, we want to be the best even if it cost the fall of someone else, but that is not Love.

Love is watching your friend succeed no matter what it cost, love is letting a stranger have your lunch, Love is staying there for somebody because they need it, love is praying for somebody even in their absence, love is having the best interest of somebody at heart, even if they have hurt you, love is giving,  Love is SACRIFICE.

Loving does not come with a particular race, religion or ethnicity, love everybody. 

Love according to God's own principles;

* Love your neighbor as yourselves [Matt 22: 39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+22%3A39&version=NIV)
* Love because you know God [1 John 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1john+4%3A8&version=NIV)
* love because it gives no record of wrongs [1 Cor 13:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor+13%3A4-5&version=NIV)
* Love because it covers multitude of sins [1 Peter 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4%3A8&version=NIV)
* Love because it comes from God [1 John 4:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A7&version=NIV)

Over all, Love unconditionally. 

Now, does love truly matter? YES! Everyday, love matters. it plays a crucial role in our relationship with our spouse, friends, family and even colleagues. Love does matter.
