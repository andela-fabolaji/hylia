How do you explain love when its you on the giving side? 

Some days ago, while having a discussion with a very close friend of mine surrounding life, love and people in general, he (my friend) went on to lament about how a supposed friend of his will not put him up for the jobs he had at his disposal, but will always come back to ask for his opinion on some of this jobs he had refused to give out- wanting to gain from his (my friend's) knowledge. Let's say his friend wants to keep using him to his own advantage, but does not want to give him anything in return, and this aroused that big question in me- What do 'you' know about love, and how do you explain it from the context of the giver? how does one love truly and genuinely without being in a romantic relationship with the other person?  Let's see; Well here goes something on this, stay with me. 

The truth is, often times we get too engulfed with this word "Love" because it is only very easy to say rather than do- the action of the word itself. Our definition of love although differ because of our human mind and its uniqueness in the way it process and react to things, but no definition can beat love as "sacrifice". If truly you love me, how far can you go for me?

A quick question to ponder on, *can you love another genuinely without loving yourself ?* 

Loving another is very hard, but loving yourself is harder because we are humans and we tend  to react to some changes that has to do with us and words said by people- this can affect our self-love and degrade our self esteem. 

Loving yourself should always be the first step in this "love process" because, if you can love yourself genuinely and wholeheartedly,  loving another should never be challenging because you have experienced Love first hand.  In fact at this time, it will be very hard to take love for granted, and remain friends with someone who can not love you genuinely(it gives you value in yourself). The instruction of loving according to the Bible says "Love your neighbor as yourself" because it is assumed that you love yourself. SELF LOVE IS IMPORTANT!

Now How do you love another? do you love your friend enough to let them take that scholarship meant for you just because they need it more than you do? Can you let your colleague take that promotion because they fit better in that position more than you will? Well, this is a little hard because we are human and every time, we want our ego to win, we want to be the best even if it cost the fall of someone else. Love happens when we begin to to see life from another person's view, when we try to be empathetic and try to examine how our little act of showing love can bring so much happiness to another.

Love is seeing your friend succeed no matter what it cost, love is letting a stranger have your lunch even when you are hungry because they need it more, Love is staying there for somebody because they need you, love is praying for somebody even at their absence, love is having the best interest of somebody at heart even if they have hurt you, love is giving,  Love is SACRIFICE.

Loving does not come with a particular race, religion or ethnicity- love everybody. 

Love according to God's own principles:

* Love your neighbor as yourselves [Matt 22: 39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt+22%3A39&version=NIV)
* Love because you know God [1 John 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1john+4%3A8&version=NIV)
* Love because it gives no record of wrongs [1 Cor 13:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor+13%3A4-5&version=NIV)
* Love because it covers multitude of sins [1 Peter 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4%3A8&version=NIV)
* Love because it comes from God [1 John 4:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A7&version=NIV)

Over all, Love unconditionally. 

Now, does love truly matter? YES! Everyday, love matters. it plays a crucial role in our relationship with ourselves, our spouse, friends, family, colleague and even strangers. Love does matter.  show somebody love today.
