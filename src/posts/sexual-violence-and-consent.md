Hey there, its been a lot to take in, right? i know, especially with all that has been going on around lately.  it's been an overwhelming year around the world- the pandemic, rape reports, police brutality, racism, unjust killings and all, i also know how mentally draining all of these are, but God still Got us, He will never leave us hanging, Hold forth!

The truth is, it's sad to see how much women have lost their lives from this traumatic experience, we will join hands to keep fighting this non-stop, Rapists deserve to be castrated!

If you have ever been a victim of sexual assault, molestation, or have lost a close pal to any of these, i want you to know that it is okay to have this "emotions" range from the recent happenings, it is normal but You are strong, you will be fine, you will heal, give it time. 

Today, i am sharing my take on this very vital topic. one that has brought a lot of people pain, fear and trauma. 

Often times, sexual assault happens as a result of certain individuals not knowing what "consent" means, and it is very important to always educate ourselves and the people around us.

What is consent?

Simply put, Consent means giving permission for something to happen. and so, in this context, consent is simply getting a go ahead from the other party before an "act" takes place. please note;

*They are your spouse is not consent* 

*They are drunk is not consent* 

*They are vulnerable is not consent* 

*They slept over is not consent* 

*They are free with you is not consent!* 

*They said "maybe" is not consent!* 

*They slept on same bed with you is not consent* 

*"we" have done it before is not consent.*

Consent is having somebody's **full permission** to do something. Do not assume, always ask.

There is really no way to prevent this act from happening But we can try by educating our ward on the appropriate measures to take and bringing them up appropriately.. but this is still not enough! These rapists will keep doing their thing, and it is right for us to keep seeking justice for their victims, especially the ones who have spoken out despite the hurdles and stigmatization they might face.  

Please remember to educate Somebody today on what consent means.

Do not forget to fight for the future, talk to a child or teen in your care today, teach them to flee from any "uncle" or "aunty" trying to touch them in an inappropriate manner, train them to speak up and stand up for what is right always, teach them to trust you, believe in them. 

My sincere prayers to Everyone who has gone through any of these, may God heal you and give you reasons to be happy always. 

Love always,

Jane.
