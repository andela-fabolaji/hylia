Hey there, how do you feel, especially with all that has been going on around lately? well, i know its been an overwhelming  year around the world- the pandemic, rape reports, police brutality, racism, unjust killing and all, i also know how mentally draining all of this is, but God still Got us, He will never leave us hanging, Hold forth!

To begin with, if you have ever been a victim of sexual assault, molestation, or have lost a close pal to any of these, i want you to know that it is okay to have this "emotions" range from these recent happenings, it is normal.  You are strong, you will be fine, you will heal, give it time. 

Today, i am sharing my take on this very vital topic. one that has brought a lot of people pain, fear and trauma. 

Often times, sexual assault happens as a result of certain individuals not knowing what "consent" means, and it is very important to always educate ourselves and people around us.

What is consent?

Simply put, Consent means giving permission for something to happen. and so, in this context, consent is simply getting a go ahead from the other party before the "act" takes place. please note;

*They are your spouse is not consent* 

*They are drunk is not consent They are vulnerable is not consent
They slept over is not consent
They are free with you is not consent!
They said "maybe" is not consent!
They slept on same bed with you is not consent
"we" have done it before is not consent.*

Consent is having somebody's **full permission** to do something, do not assume, always ask.

There is really no way to prevent this act from happening But we can try by educating our ward on the appropriate measures to take and bringing them up appropriately.. but this is still not enough! These rapists will keep doing their thing, and it is right for us to keep seeking justice for their victims, especially the ones who have spoken out despite the hurdles and stigmatization they might face.  

My prayers are with Everyone who has gone through this, God heal you, and give you solace always. 

Please remember to educate Somebody today on what consent means.

Do not forget to talk a child or teen in your care today, teach them to flee from any "uncle" or "aunty" trying to touch them in an inappropriate manner, train them to speak up and trust you. 

Love always,  Jane
