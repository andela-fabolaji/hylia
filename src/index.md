Welcome on board, come right in.

My name is **Janet Ajewole** fondly called *Jane.* i am a Nigerian and a Grace-filled Christian. I am obsessed humanitarian- as i have a profound passion for helping the less privileged and indigent kids, as well as single and struggling mother in the society. whenever i am opportune to, I volunteer for like Courses. In light of this, i am an active volunteer with *Do Good Charity Initiative* where i hold the post *of*  the team lead and social media manager.

Well,  If i am asked where i see myself in the nearest future, without thinking, it definitely would be as content creator, creative writer, copy writer, digital marketer and a vlogger, which is part of reason i have created this personal space.

In this space, i would share my random thoughts and ideas which i think will be beneficial to YOU especially in that time you just need to get things off and be alone with your device, i promise to make you feel at home and safe. i hope you find this space pleasant, exciting and inspiring.

I am super glad to have you be a part of my journey. please know this, its a safe place here.
