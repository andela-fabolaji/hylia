Welcome on board, come right in.

My name is **Janet Ajewole** fondly called *Jane -* a Nigerian and a Grace-filled Christian. I'm an obsessed humanitarian with a profound passion for helping the less privileged, indigent kids, as well as single and struggling mothers in the society. I currently volunteer as a Team Lead and Social Media Manager for *Do Good Charity Initiative*.

My aspiration to hone my skills across different disciplines - Content Creation, Creative & Copy Writing, Digital Marketing and Vlogging - motivated me to create this blog to share my thoughts and progress. In this space, I will share useful nuggets, fun stuff and ideas that I find intriguing, inspirational and beneficial to my audience. I promise to make this worth your time.

I am super glad to have you be a part of my journey. Please know this: its a safe place here. So, feel free to share your thoughts, opinions and feedback via my [email](ajewoleglory@gmail.com) You can also follow my pages on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jane_vigour/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/JaneVigour). 

*With love, Jane.*
