## **A little story of me...**

![](/images/fav.jpg)

my name is **Janet Ajewole** fondly called *Jane -* a Nigerian and a Grace-filled Christian. I'm an obsessed humanitarian with a profound passion for helping the less privileged, indigent kids, as well as single and struggling mothers in the society. I currently volunteer as a Team Lead and Social Media Manager for *Do Good Charity Initiative*. 

## **About the blog**

My aspiration to hone my skills across different disciplines - Content Creation, Creative & Copy Writing, Digital Marketing and Vlogging - motivated me to create this blog to share my thoughts and progress. In this space, I will share useful nuggets, fun stuff and ideas that I find intriguing, inspirational and beneficial to my audience. I promise to make this worth your time.
